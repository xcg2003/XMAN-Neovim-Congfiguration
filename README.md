# Xman's personal neovim configuration


## Step 1: Download Neovim

In order to use this config you need to be running Neovim 11.o or later. You can download the lastest version of Neovim for your system [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases).

## Step 2: Clone this repo

Open a terminal and run the following command to clone this repo: 

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/xcg2003/XMAN-Neovim-Congfiguration.git"
```

This will create a copy of the repo on your machine.

## Step 3: Add the repo to the .config directory

Make sure that there is a nvim folder in the ~/.config/ folder. You can create the folder with the following command:

```bash
mkdir ~/.config/nvim
```

Once the nvim folder is created run the following commands in your terminal to copy the repo contents into the ~/.config/nvim folder

```bash
cp -r xman-nvim-config/* ~/.config/nvim/
```
## Step 4: Start Neovim

Start Neovim and it should have all of the themes, shortcuts, auto-completion that is included in this config. This works on all operatiating systems so there should be no errors.
